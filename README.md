# AAA_2025
Welcome to the repository of the course "Advanced Analytics and Applications (AAA)" in Summer Semester 2025. We will use this space as the central point for sharing code, data and instructions with you over the course of this semester.

You should check this repo regularly to view and/or download newly released or updated files. If you have experience using git or if you want to learn how to work with a state-of-the-art version control system, you may wish to fork and regularly pull updates to the repository onto your local machine for convenience.

A good first stop for all questions that are not subject-related but relate to how to use these kinds of tools you can have a look here (and request new guides by using issue templates): [IS3 Teaching Repository](https://github.com/IS3UniCologne/teaching-material)
